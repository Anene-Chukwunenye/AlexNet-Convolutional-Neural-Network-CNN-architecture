# AlexNet-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-architecture

#### AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

### The CIFAR-10 dataset was used in training the model

#### CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. It was collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
